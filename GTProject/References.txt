This is my Research and Reference Page for my Project.

My Go To Reference Down Below. Very Deatiled description of Infix to Postfix.
http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/InfixPrefixandPostfixExpressions.html

This Reference is quite short but makes the compile function alot easier to understand. I find 
w3schools very helpful with their example snippets of code. I went through the videos but wanted
to know basics, this helped.
