This is my Research and Reference Page for my Project.

My Go To Reference Down Below. Very Deatiled description of Infix to Postfix.
http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/InfixPrefixandPostfixExpressions.html

Video on Shunting Yard Algorithm using stack. Very Helpful and made it easier 
to understand decent breakdown of it.

Small video on def functions in python. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owglNL1KQf0

Nice informative piece on Thompsons Construction.

This Reference is quite short but makes the compile function alot easier to understand. I find 
w3schools very helpful with their example snippets of code. I went through the videos but wanted
to know basics, this helped.

Good Help/Guide for my Shunting Yard Algorithm Code & string to infix function. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42703422/infix-to-postfix-algorithm-in-python

This was a great help in allowing me to implement user input into my project. 
I wanted the user to be able enter their own infixes and strings for the matching algorithm.

Nice Website where you can input Regular Expressions and convert them to NFA. 
Converter website which came in handy for checking and understanding it more.

Gave me a quick and better understanding of an NFA.

I found the lecture videos very helpful throughout this project.
The intro videos helped introduce me to a new language for me and 
gave me a better understanding of how python works. Very Helpful and Useful
videos.
