# Graph-Theory-Project
This is My Graph Theory Project Yr3

First Commit - Setting Up Repository for project. No Code.

Second Commit - Shunting Yard Algorithm. Coding Began, added loop for character input. 

Third Commit - Thompsons Construction. Nfa and State classes made with inital and accept states also added. No issues so far.

Fourth Commit - Set up Compile function for C. Will now test with print in cmder for Shunting Yard Algorithm & Thompsons Construction.

Fifth Commit - Added print functions to Shunting Yard Algorithm and Thompsons Construction. SYA printed, need to fix Thompsons Construction print. 

Sixth Commit - Here i continued on, i added the followes function for the state. Will then move on to the match function and try get the cmder printing out results.

Seventh Commit - In this commit i inserted a match function. I am now printing in cmder. I also fixed my Thompsons Construction code. Messed around with special numbers (specials) and my loops and managed to fix the issue. I also researched more and added the references used to the text doc.

Eighth Commit - Here i wanted to individually test my shunting yard algorithm on its own. Works !

Ninth Commit - More Research added and referenced on Thompsons Construction. 

Tenth Commit - Added user input for matching algorithm. Also added another bit of research and refernced it. This aided me in being able to implement user input to my code.
